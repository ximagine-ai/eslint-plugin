## Rule Details

This rule prevents type assertions on object literals unless there's a comment explaining why it's necessary in the line above.

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
const config = {} as Config;

const user = { name: "John" } as User;

// Comment that is not on the line immediately before the assertion

const data = { id: 1 } as Data;
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
// Have a comment explaining why the assertion is necessary
// Need to assert empty object as Config for initialization
const config = {} as Config;

// Object declaration with type
const data: Data = { id: 1 };
```
