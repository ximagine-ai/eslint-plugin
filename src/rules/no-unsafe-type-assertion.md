## Rule Details

This rule prevents unsafe type assertions through `unknown` or `any` intermediaries unless there's a comment explaining why it's necessary in the line above.

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
const value = someValue as unknown as TargetType;
const data = response as any as UserData;

// Comment that is not on the line immediately before the assertion

const config = rawConfig as unknown as Config;
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
// Have a comment explaining why the assertion is necessary
// Need to cast through unknown because the source type is from an external library
const value = someValue as unknown as TargetType;

// Direct assertion when types are compatible
const config = rawConfig as Config;
```
